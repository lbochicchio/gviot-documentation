# **2 What, why, when**

## 2.1 What is the GV IoT platform?

The GV IoT Platform integrates IoT devices to enterprise or cloud systems. It allows the user to create and manage their own IoT ecosystem by facilitating data flow, communication between objects, device management and, in general, enabling advanced application functionalities.

One of the most important missions of the GV IoT platform is to make objects speak, with a strong orientation towards infrastructures such as bridges, tunnels, construction sites, buildings, wind turbines and in general all infrastructures that need maintenance and monitoring. In general understand from the huge amount of data that they communicate their health. To prevent, in this way, failures or problems.

For this reason we collaborate with companies that have solid background in monitoring infrastructures, with companies that produce sensors and with expert in the field of what has to be monitored.

Collaborating with physicists, geologists, construction engineers is what makes the difference in succeeding in these projects. We strongly believe that the sum of two competences produces more than their pure algebraic result. Only facing a problem from different perspectives and different backgrounds, in a interdisciplinary approach, permits to solve problems better and faster. 

### 2.1.1 Main characteristics of the GV IoT platform and its top 3 killing features

The GV IoT platform has been designed to solve many IoT needs. These are a list of its features:

* Gateway

    * Its architecture extends and facilitates edge computing

    * Data normalization

    * Filtering

    * Security gate

    * Support for multi protocol communication between the device and the platform

    * Data ingestion modules to elaborate huge amount of data

    * Auto provisioning for new Things and Devices. It can be enable ON or OFF from the console

* Decoupling

    * Based on the Open Source Kafka infrastructure, that proved to be disruptive in many areas

    * Scalability and isolation for the entire platform

    * Back pressure regulation

    * Backbone for all internal communication

* DataPump

    * Security gate

    * Data enrichment

    * Filtering

    * Multi synch architecture, to support any type of store or streaming systems like: Mongo, Cassandra, relational DBs, Hadoop, Spark, Confluent KSQL and many others

* Core

    * "API first" design for use in headless environment

    * Auditing at core API level: any operation on devices, things or networks (D/T/N) is storicized by the platform

    * Query module to get meta info from N/T/D and to get telemetry data from your devices

* Store

    * Any combination of Datalakes, BigData, streaming modules

* General characteristics

    * Built on Open Source technologies: Spring, Kafka, Mongo, MySql, MQTT, Angular, Node

    * Secured by design

    * Analytics. Real time alerts and CEP

    * Machine learning

    * E2E traceability functionalities

    * Auto monitoring modules

    * Events generated from D/T/N can trigger event notifications

* Console

    * Stream processing

    * Time series graphs on data coming from the devices

    * Frequency analysis

    * Georeferenced graphs and tables

        * Google maps, OpenStreet map, WebGIS

    * Integrated lightweight ticketing system

    * Integrated logbook for production groups to log activities

    * Integrated lightweight CMS (docs related to D/T/N: Devices/Things/Network)

Its top 3 features are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Top 3 features</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>eXtreme scalability</td>
    <td>We have developed a platform that can be setup to manage any type of load. It can do so, through extreme scalability of any component of the platform.

From a single industrial computer on the field to a cluster of thousands of connected computer in the cloud, we can tailor the solution to best respond to your needs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Open API</td>
    <td>Any operation you can do from the console can be also done via API.

The entire platform follows the "API first approach".

Note: If the console, with its dashboards customizable by users, wouldn't be enough, we at GreenVulcano can rapidly implement vertical solution with a personalized console to operate your own installation of the GV IoT platform.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Security by design</td>
    <td>Your data is what it is important. They are secured by design, using advanced access policies and protections at the gates (gateways) and on the data.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


In addition the GV IoT platform can:

* Integrate other systems through the Open Source GreenVulcano® ESB platform

* Automatise your work through GreenVulcano® Claudio.

## 2.2 Why did we develop the GV IoT platform?

Our experience in complex system integration over the last 18 years, that lately evolved in interfacing IoT devices (OBD: On Board Devices) for car sharing and fleets management and our more recent involvement in monitoring of infrastructures as tunnels and bridges, made us believe that the best solution for us was to build a software that, other than to have all characteristics needed by an IoT platform, was also complemented with the other two GreenVulcano products: GV ESB to enable solid integration capabilities and workflow managements and Claudio, which serves as a modern and easy to use automation tool for managers.

## 2.3 When to use the GV IoT platform?

There are many reasons why it is important to have a well designed IoT platform for your projects. Some of the reasons are listed below in the picture. But besides technical aspects, and not less important, is to choose an IoT platform supported by a company, that will walk with you during the entire lifecycle of your IoT project, from the initial design of the solution to the production and post-production phases.
