# What is it 

The GV IoT Platform integrates IoT devices to enterprise or cloud systems.

It allows the user to create and manage their own IoT ecosystem by facilitating
data flow, communication between objects, device management and, in general,
enabling advanced application functionalities.

One of the most important missions of the GV IoT platform is to make objects speak, with a strong orientation towards infrastructures such as bridges, tunnels, construction sites, buildings, wind turbines and in general all infrastructures that need maintenance and monitoring.

In general, understand from the huge amount of data that the objects communicate, the health of the object itself. To prevent, in this way, failures or problems.

For this reason we collaborate with companies that have solid background in monitoring infrastructures, with companies that produce sensors and with expert in the field of what has to be monitored.

Collaborating with physicists, geologists, construction engineers is what makes the difference in succeeding in these projects. We strongly believe that the sum of two competences produces more than their pure algebraic result. Only facing a problem from different perspectives and different backgrounds, in a interdisciplinary approach, permits to solve problems better and faster. 

Next picture describes what the platform does and how raw data from the objects are transormed by the platform into normalized and queryable data.
At this stage data are generally stored into BigData infrastructure and ready for analytics.

It is at this last step that the business value is added:

- Alarms
- Reports
- Prediction
- Automatic actions
- Certifications of the data transmitted (ex. in BlockChain)
