### Installation

The GVIoT platform requires the following software, we recommend to follow the the installation guidelines for each:

* Java Platform, Standard Edition 11 Reference Implementation
* Apache Kafka
* Apache ActiveMQ
* MongoDB
* MySQL

You can set up a GVIoT platform on single machine, only for demonstration purposes. This is not recommended for production. This type of installation requires at least 4 cores CPU and 8GB of RAM.

In a production environment, ensure that data is redundant and that your systems are highly available.
