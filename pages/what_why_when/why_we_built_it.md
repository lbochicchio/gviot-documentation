# Why we built it 

Our experience in complex system integration over the last 18 years, that lately evolved in interfacing IoT devices for car sharing and fleets management and our more recent involvement in monitoring of infrastructures as tunnels and bridges, made us believe that the best solution for us was to build a software that, other than to have all characteristics needed by an IoT platform, was also complemented with the other two GreenVulcano products, to work as a suite:

- GV ESB to enable solid integration capabilities and workflow managements
- Claudio, which serves as a modern and easy to use automation tool for managers
